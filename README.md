# mario-kart-8-vehicle-generator
 Randomly generates a kart and character for you to race with in Mario Kart 8

 The idea for this came form playing Mario Kart 8 with my sister, where we would often attempt to randomly select new karts to play in to switch it up from our usual favourites and discover new karts that worked for us. This simple idea turned into my first Python project (and first-ever coding project)!

 This was built when I was about halfway through Codecademy's intoructory Learn Python 3 course, and I intend to build upon it as I learn more.
